    """ Computes weights estimates for human powered aircraft
    
    Assumptions:
       All of this is from AIAA 89-2048, units are in kg. These weight estimates
       are from the MIT Daedalus and are valid for very lightweight
       carbon fiber composite structures. This may need to be solved iteratively since
       gross weight is an input.
