def compute_operating_items_weight(vehicle):
    """ Calculate the weight of operating items, including:
        - crew
        - baggage
        - unusable fuel
        - engine oil
        - passenger service
        - ammunition and non-fixed weapons
        - cargo containers

        Assumptions:
            If no tanks are specified, 5 fuel tanks are assumed (includes main and auxiliary tanks)
            If the number of coach seats is not defined, then it assumed that 5% of
                of the seats are first class and an additional 10 % are business class.
            If the number of coach seats is defined, then the additional seats are 1/4 first class
                and 3/4 business class
